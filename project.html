            <h1>About Me!</h1>
            <p align="justify">Hello! I'm a passionate and driven individual navigating the exciting world of Information Technology. Currently a first-year irregular IT student, I aspire to achieve a Doctorate in IT and make meaningful contributions to the tech industry. Beyond academics, I find joy in urban gardening, nurturing a grafted mango tree that represents my dedication to growth and innovation. My curiosity extends to exploring creative projects, from designing wireframe layouts to assembling PCs, showcasing my hands-on approach to learning. I admire resilience and hard work, inspired by groups like BINI, who have been a source of strength during challenging times. With a knack for balancing practical problem-solving and personal passions, I aim to leave a mark in both my career and community. Welcome to my portfolioâ€”where dreams, ideas, and aspirations take center stage!</p align="justify">
