            <h1>Achievements and Activities</h1>
            <p align="justify">Throughout my academic journey, I have consistently excelled, maintaining honors from junior high school through senior high school. My commitment to learning and leadership led me to become a student mentor, where I guided my peers and contributed to their success. Iâ€™ve proudly received numerous accolades, including the <strong>Infotech Award</strong> for my dedication to technology and the title of <strong>Mr. Intramurals</strong>, showcasing my well-rounded skills. Beyond academics, I actively engaged in school activities and organizations that fostered personal growth and teamwork. For example, I volunteered for school events such as annual fairs and charity drives, took on leadership roles in organizing class activities, and participated in sports competitions. These experiences enriched my perspective and prepared me to tackle challenges with confidence and collaboration.</p align="justify">
