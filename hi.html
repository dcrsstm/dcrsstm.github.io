            <h1>Hobbies and Interests</h1>
            <p align="justify">When I’m not focused on school or projects, you’ll often catch me playing Valorant or exploring Genshin Impact—gaming is my ultimate escape. I’m all about that competitive energy, but I also love getting wrapped up in the worlds and stories of the games. Outside of gaming, I’m a huge karaoke fan—singing with friends is one of my favorite ways to unwind. I’m also a big Marvel enthusiast, always ready to watch the latest films and shows. When I’m chilling with a cup of coffee in hand, I’m either recharging or diving into the latest BINI music videos. BINI is my favorite girl group, and I can’t get enough of their dedication and talent. Mikha and Colet are my biases, and I love supporting them on their journey.</p align="justify">
